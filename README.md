### About the Book
"Grokking Algorithms" is a beginner-friendly guide to understanding algorithms and solving coding problems. It uses a mix of real-world examples, visual representations, and simple explanations to demystify complex algorithms. By the end of the book, readers will have a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and be able to apply them to solve various types of problems.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized into chapters, with each chapter covering different algorithms or concepts. The code examples and exercise solutions are provided in C language.

* Chapter1: Introduction to algorithms
* Chapter2: Selection sort
* Chapter3: Recursion
* Chapter4: Quicksort
* Chapter5: Hash tables
* Chapter6: Breadth-first search
* Chapter7: Dijkstra's algorithm
* Chapter8: Greedy algorithms
* Chapter9: Dynamic programming
* Chapter10: K-nearest neighbors
